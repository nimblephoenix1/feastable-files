This program demonstrates the use of a timer in a 2D game and also using the keyboard entry to control which boosters are fired on the lander module.
It makes used of the graphics.h header file. It uses the XOR option to draw the lander over what is on the screen and then use the same XOR Process to put the screen
back the way it was before calculation the next location of the lander module.
It displays the speed right and speed down of the lander module. It also performs a conversion to an acceptable data type to the function that displays
the data to the graphics screen. 
Limitations: it doesn't have a crash function or landing routine but is a good model of the logic to create a real time user-controlled simulation program
